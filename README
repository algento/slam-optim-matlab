The SAMToolbox implements the SAM and iSAM metrods from the papers:

Square Root SAM: SLAM via Square Root Information Smoothing, F. Dellaert and M. Kaess, IJRR, 2006
iSAM: Incremental Smoothing and Mapping, M. Kaess, A. Ranganathan, and F. Dellaert, IEEE TRO, 2008 

The toolbox requires Tim Davis SuiteSparse toolbox which can be downloaded from here: 
http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse/'

Download and install the toolbox before using the toolbox.

Run startup.m before running any other script from the toolbox.

The dataset must be in .graph format. See examples in ./Data

Run ./Tests/testNonlinearOptimization.m to get familiar with the toolbox.
Set the flag "incremental" to process the data incremental.
You can also change the Solver and Plot options.
